# Food Class Prediction
This project focuses on Food Classification using machine learning techniques, aimed at identifying different types of food from images. The system leverages a trained model to predict the category of food based on its visual characteristics.

Features:
Image-Based Food Classification: Upload an image of food, and the system will predict the food category.

Pretrained Model: The model is built using InceptionV3 for transfer learning to improve the accuracy of predictions.

Multiclass Classification: The system supports multiple food categories for classification.

Technologies Used:
Python with TensorFlow and Keras for building and training the model.

Transfer Learning using the InceptionV3 model to improve performance.

OpenCV for image preprocessing and handling.

NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation.

How to Use:
Upload an image of a food item.

The system processes the image and predicts the food category.

View the predicted class and confidence score.

Future Enhancements:
Expand the dataset to cover more food categories for better classification accuracy.

Add real-time food recognition using a camera interface.

Incorporate nutritional information about the predicted food category.
